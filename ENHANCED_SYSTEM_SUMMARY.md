## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/selection-history          - Load user data and analytics
POST /api/selection-history          - Save selections and update analytics
PUT  /api/selection-history          - Update existing selections
DELETE /api/selection-history        - Delete selections
POST /api/enhanced-predictions       - Generate personalized predictions
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
// User Analytics
{
  userId: "unique-browser-fingerprint",
  totalSelections: 25,
  favoriteNumbers: [7, 14, 21, 28, 35],
  preferredStrategies: { "Frequency": 10, "Pattern": 8, "Gap": 7 },
  averageConfidence: 72.5,
  patternInsights: { /* detailed analysis */ }
}

// Enhanced Prediction
{
  numbers: [5, 12, 23, 34, 45],
  powerball: 18,
  strategy: "Enhanced Frequency",
  confidence: 78,
  userEnhancement: 12,
  personalizedFactors: ["Favorite number match", "Preferred strategy"]
}
```

### Storage Architecture
- **Server Storage**: `/tmp/lottery-selections/` directory structure
- **User Files**: Individual JSON files per user ID
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old files cleaned up periodically
- **Fallback Storage**: localStorage for offline functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Prediction Algorithms

### 1. EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
- Gives more weight to recent draws
- Enhanced with user's favorite numbers
- Confidence boosted by historical performance

### 2. Pattern Analysis
- Identifies number sequence patterns
- Incorporates user's selection patterns
- Adjusts for user's preferred number ranges

### 3. Gap Analysis
- Analyzes gaps between number appearances
- Considers user's gap preferences
- Enhanced confidence for familiar gap patterns

### 4. Markov Chain
- Predicts based on number transition probabilities
- Weighted by user's historical transitions
- Confidence adjusted for pattern familiarity

### 5. Composite Algorithm
- Combines multiple algorithms
- Weighted by user's strategy preferences
- Highest confidence for experienced users

## ðŸ“ˆ Confidence Scoring System

### Base Confidence Factors
- Historical data quality (20%)
- Algorithm performance (25%)
- Pattern strength (20%)
- Statistical significance (15%)

### User Enhancement Factors
- Favorite number matches (+5-15%)
- Preferred strategy bonus (+3-10%)
- Historical success rate (+2-8%)
- Selection frequency bonus (+1-5%)

### Final Confidence Calculation
```
Final Confidence = Base Confidence + User Enhancement + Algorithm Bonus
Maximum: 95% (to maintain realistic expectations)
Minimum: 15% (to avoid false confidence)
```
